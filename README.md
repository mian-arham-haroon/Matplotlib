## 📖 About Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a powerful library for creating a variety of visualizations in Python, making it an essential tool for data analysis and presentation.

## Lecture Notes

### Introduction to Matplotlib
- Overview of Matplotlib and its importance in data visualization.
- Key components: `pyplot`, figures, axes, and plots.

### Plot Types
- Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more.
- Choosing the right plot for your data.

### Customization
- Adding titles, labels, legends, and annotations.
- Adjusting colors, styles, and markers.

### Advanced Features
- Subplots and grid layouts.
- Interactive visualizations and animations.

## Training Material

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mian-arham-haroon/matplotlib_lectures.git
cd matplotlib_lectures




## ✅ 2. `requirements.txt`

```txt
matplotlib
jupyter

### Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install matplotlib jupyter
jupyter notebook
```
Install Matplotlib using pip:


```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example Data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]

# Creating a Plot
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sample Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
```

### Exercises
1. Create a bar chart to visualize sales data.
2. Plot a scatter plot to analyze relationships between two variables.
3. Customize a line plot with different colors and markers.
